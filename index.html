            <!-- <ul>
                <li>Research the fishing destination you're planning to visit. Learn about the local fish species,
                    fishing regulations, seasons, and popular fishing spots.</li>
                <li>Make sure you understand the fishing regulations and requirements for the area you'll be fishing in.
                    Obtain any necessary fishing licenses or permits before you start fishing.</li>
                <li>Pack the right fishing gear for your target species and the fishing environment. This includes rods,
                    reels, lines, hooks, lures, bait, and any other specific equipment you might need.</li>
                <li>Wear appropriate clothing for the weather and fishing conditions. Sun protection, waterproof
                    clothing, and comfortable footwear are important.</li>
                <li>Prioritize safety by wearing a life jacket if you'll be on a boat, and be cautious when wading in
                    water. Follow any safety guidelines provided by the fishing charter or location.</li>

            <h2>Tank Process</h2>
            <!-- <ol>
                <li>Regular water changes are vital for removing accumulated waste, excess nutrients, and maintaining water quality. Partial water changes (typically 10-20% of the tank volume) should be performed on a regular basis, such as weekly or bi-weekly.</li>
                <li>A reliable filtration system (mechanical, biological, and chemical) helps remove debris, toxins, and excess nutrients from the water. Clean or replace filter media as needed to ensure optimal filtration efficiency.</li>
                <li>Regularly test water parameters such as ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, salinity (for saltwater), and temperature. Test kits are available to help you monitor and maintain appropriate levels.</li>
                <li>For freshwater aquariums, use a reliable aquarium heater to maintain a stable water temperature within the appropriate range for your fish species. In saltwater aquariums, use a heater and a chiller if necessary to maintain the desired temperature.</li>
                <li>For saltwater aquariums, maintain proper salinity levels using a refractometer or hydrometer. Regularly check and adjust the salinity to match the requirements of your specific marine organisms.</li>
                <li>Ensure proper aeration and water circulation within the tank to distribute heat, oxygen, and nutrients evenly.</li>
                <li>Remember that every aquarium is unique, and the care requirements can vary based on the species of fish, plants, and the size of the tank. Regular maintenance and consistent monitoring will help you provide a clean, safe, and comfortable environment for your aquatic pets.</li>
